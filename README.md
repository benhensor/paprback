# Paprback

This is a rebuild of my School of Code project Paprback, an app for connecting local people for exchanging used books.

## Overview

Our final team project with the School of Code was an original concept created by the team as the result of UX research into a real-wrold problem that could be addressed with a technological solution. We decided to create Paprback as a tool to help local people recycle and discover books by connecting with people in their local area. The app allows you to create an account, sign in and create listings for your books that are then searchable by the community of users. Users can search a database of books listed by other users and controls for making contact with the user who has a copy of the book you want, and the means to arrange an exchange or collection.

The requirements for the SoC was a fully functioning WIP for demonstration purposes. As a way to practice building full stack applications, I have decided to revisit this project and improve the functionality to make the app a little more complete from a user perspective.

### Tech Stack

The orignal full stack project was built in React, with an Express server, connecting to a PostgreSQL database.

This new production is built in React with TypeScript, an Express JS server and PostgreSQL database. Routing is handled by React Router.
